GPS sensor input message.  This is a raw sensor value sent by the GPS.
This is NOT the global position estimate of the
system.

time_usec                 : Timestamp (UNIX Epoch time or time since system boot). The receiving end can infer timestamp format (since 1.1.1970 or since system boot) by checking for the magnitude of the number. [us] (type:uint64_t)
gps_id                    : ID of the GPS for multiple GPS inputs (type:uint8_t)
ignore_flags              : Bitmap indicating which GPS input flags fields to ignore.  All other fields must be provided. (type:uint16_t, values:GPS_INPUT_IGNORE_FLAGS)
time_week_ms        GPGGA : GPS time (from start of GPS week) [ms] (type:uint32_t)
time_week           GPGGA : GPS week number (type:uint16_t)
fix_type            GPGGA : 0-1: no fix, 2: 2D fix, 3: 3D fix. 4: 3D with DGPS. 5: 3D with RTK (type:uint8_t)
lat                 GPGGA : Latitude (WGS84) [degE7] (type:int32_t)
lon                 GPGGA : Longitude (WGS84) [degE7] (type:int32_t)
alt                 GPGGA : Altitude (MSL). Positive for up. [m] (type:float)
hdop                GPGSA : GPS HDOP horizontal dilution of position (unitless). If unknown, set to: UINT16_MAX (type:float)
vdop                GPGSA : GPS VDOP vertical dilution of position (unitless). If unknown, set to: UINT16_MAX (type:float)
vn                  GPVTG : GPS velocity in north direction in earth-fixed NED frame [m/s] (type:float)
ve                  GPVTG : GPS velocity in east direction in earth-fixed NED frame [m/s] (type:float)
vd                  ?
satellites_visible  GPGSA?: Number of satellites visible. (type:uint8_t)
yaw                 PSAT,HPR : Yaw of vehicle relative to Earth's North, zero means not available, use 36000 for north [cdeg] (type:uint16_t)
